# Contributing

Your contributions are most welcome!

## Guidelines

* Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
* Add your links like: `* [name](http://example.com) - A short description ends with a dot.`
* If possible, input the web domain names only, as links to the particular web-pages may expire.
* Make a remark _proprietary_ if the content is not freely available.
* Check your spelling and grammar. We recommend you using [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/).
* Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.


## How to contribute

1. [Open a new issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue) and explain your changes.
2. [Create a new branch](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging) for your addition. You can create a new branch in the issue you just open and work in there.
3. [Make a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) in which you add short description of why the project/resource/tool is awesome.
